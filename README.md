# CS 131 Fall 2022: Project Starter

Hey there! This is a template repository that contains the necessary boilerplate for [CS 131](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-22/)'s quarter-long project: making an interpreter. The project specs are as follows:

1. [Project 1 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Q4EPgHLMlMuQABhmgTpk_Ggxij0DZwvPQO2uzVVPzk/)
2. Project 2 - coming soon!
3. Project 3 - coming soon!

There are three stages to the project; students are currently at the first. Thus, this folder contains the necessary bootstrapping code:

- `intbase.py`, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
- a sample `readme.txt`, which should illustrate any known bugs/issues with the program (or, an "everything's good!")

Note: **we will update this repository with canonical solutions once the project deadline is over**.

Some notes on your submission (for Project 1; we'll update this for later projects):

1. You **must have a top-level, versioned `interpreterv1.py` file** that **exports the `Interpreter` class**. If not, **your code will not run on our autograder**.
2. You may also submit one or more additional `.py` modules that your interpreter uses, if you decide to break up your solution into multiple `.py` files.

You can find out more about our autograder, including how to run it, in [its accompanying repo](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/fall-22-autograder).
